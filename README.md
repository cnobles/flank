## flank

The scratch script contains a few examples of how to use the GenomicRanges::flank() function to 
manipulate GRanges or GRangesList objects.

The script also calls on the ggbio package for a function autoplot() to easily display the 
changes being made to the GRanges or GRangesList objects.
